"With the energy crisis of the early 1970s came the realization that "
"buildings could be made more efficient without sacrificing comfort. Over "
"the last 30 years, the building industry has made revolutionary changes: "
"chiller systems have decreased their power requirements by a factor of "
"two, from more than 1 kW/ton to less than 0.5 kW/ton; the use of variable"
" air volume systems has become common practice; and the use of building "
"automation systems has become the norm, with digital controls "
"increasingly replacing pneumatics. Advances in HVAC technology have "
"greatly improved building comfort and significantly decreased building "
"energy consumption. The technological advances have increased the "
"importance of proper operational practices in achieving the efficiency "
"potential of the HVAC systems. While reducing energy use is a noble goal,"
" it must not compromise comfort. Occupant comfort and productivity must "
"be maintained or improved."

"In 1999, DOE developed a practical guide for commissioning existing "
"buildings [Haasl and Sharp 1999]. Several building commissioning "
"processes are discussed in this guide. These processes include: new "
"building commissioning, existing building commissioning or retro-"
"commissioning, Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` and recommissioning. "
"While most commissioning processes focus on bringing building operation "
"to the original design intent, Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` is "
"different [1]_. Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` (CC  :sup:`SM`) "
"focuses on optimizing HVAC system operation and control for the existing "
"building conditions. This is an important distinction. Based on "
"Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` results from more than 130 buildings,"
" the average measured utility savings are about 20%, with simple paybacks"
" often in less than two years. These results are based on the experience "
"of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station’s Energy Systems Laboratory "
"at Texas A&M University during the last 10 years [Liu et al. 1994, "
"Claridge et al. 1994, Liu et al. 1999, Claridge et al. 2000]. Continuous "
"Commissioning  :sup:`SM` maintains long-term savings by ongoing "
"monitoring of energy savings with followup commissioning, as needed; "
"improves the system reliability and building comfort by optimizing system"
" operation and control schedules based on actual building conditions; "
"upgrades the operating staff’s skills by allowing direct participation of"
" O&M staff; and reduces O&M costs."
