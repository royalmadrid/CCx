"The central chiller plant includes chillers, cooling towers, a primary "
"water distribution system and the condenser water distribution system. "
"Although a secondary pumping system may be physically located inside the "
"central plant, commissioning issues dealing with secondary loops are "
"discussed in Chapter 5. The central chiller plant produces chilled water "
"using electricity, steam, hot water or gas. The detailed commissioning "
"measures vary with the type of chiller. This chapter is designed to give "
"the general commissioning measures that apply to a typical central "
"cooling plant that can produce significant energy savings."

"Most central chiller plants have several chillers with different "

"be due to the design, performance degradation, age or operational "
"problems. One chiller may have a higher efficiency at a high load ratio "
"while another may have a higher efficiency at a lower load ratio. Running"
" chillers with the highest performance can result in significant energy "
"savings and will also reduce the number of complaints because you will be"

"The chiller performance measurement involves measuring chilled water "
"production and energy input. The chilled water production can be "
"determined from measured chilled water flow and supply, and return water "
"temperatures. Flow measurement is extremely important. Do not assume the "
"flow is the design flow if there is a constant speed pump in the chiller "
"primary loop. This should be measured and can be measured accurately and "
"non-intrusively using an ultrasonic meter. To reduce the measurement "
"error, chilled water supply and return water temperatures should be "
"measured using the same sensor. This is a place where a 1°F error in the "
"temperature difference (typically around 10°F) makes an error of "
"approximately 10% in the cooling output determined for the chiller. When "
"existing meters are used, they should be calibrated before the "
"measurement. The power consumption should be determined from a true power"
" measurement instead of using percent of design current as a surrogate "
"for power measurement. The power factor varies significantly as the "
"chiller load changes. The true power fraction is often significantly "
"smaller than the current fraction under partial load. The true power can "
"be measured using an appropriate power meter. The chiller control panel "
"number may be used if it measures true power."

"For most chillers, the kW/ton decreases (COP increases) as the load ratio"
" increases from 40% to 80%. When the load ratio is too low, the capacity "
"modulation device in the chiller lowers the chiller efficiency. When the "
"chiller has a moderate load, the capacity modulation device has "
"reasonable efficiency. The condenser and evaporator are oversized for the"
" load under this condition so the chiller efficiency is higher."
