"Central heating plants produce hot water, steam, or both, typically using"
" either natural gas, coal or oil as fuel. Steam, hot water, or both are "
"distributed to buildings for HVAC systems and other end uses, such as "
"cooking, cleaning, sterilization and experiments. Figure 7-1 illustrates "
"the major components in a steam boiler with a hot water converter and a "
"hot water boiler. Boiler plant operation involves complex chemical, "
"mechanical and control processes. Energy performance and operational "
"reliability can be improved through numerous measures. However, the CCSM "
