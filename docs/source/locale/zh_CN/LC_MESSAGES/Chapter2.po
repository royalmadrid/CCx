"The term Continuous Commissioning (CC  :sup:`SM`) was first used by "
"engineers at the Texas Engineering Experiment Station’s Energy Systems "
"Lab (ESL) at Texas A&M University to describe an ongoing process that "
"improves building operation using measured hourly energy use and "
"environmental data. The first buildings to undergo a Continuous "
"CommissioningSM process were in the Texas LoanSTAR program [Liu, et al, "
"1994, Claridge, et al, 1994]. [1]_ These buildings were retrofitted with "
"various energy efficiency improvements; measured hourly data were "
"available to verify that the retrofits were performing as desired and "
"analyze the overall building performance. The ESL engineers applied the "
"CC  :sup:`SM` process to LoanSTAR buildings where it resolved major "
"comfort complaints and decreased whole building energy consumption by "
"another 15% to 30% [Gregerson, 1997]. The ESL engineers quickly applied "
"the CC  :sup:`SM` process to other types of buildings, and the results "
"were comparable in savings and comfort improvements."

"The energy savings and costs are well documented in more than 130 "
"buildings commissioned by the ESL. CC  :sup:`SM` costs consist of "
"commissioning labor costs, metering costs, and energy savings "
"determination and reporting costs. Note that the costs of replacing "
"broken or damaged parts are generally covered by the maintenance budget "
"and have not been charged to the CC  :sup:`SM` effort. The energy savings"

"After a thorough analysis, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineers developed the "

"reset based on the maximum terminal box damper position. If the maximum "
"terminal damper position is less than 80% open, the supply air "
"temperature is reset to a higher value but should not exceed the high "
"limit determined by the room relative humidity requirement. The static "
"pressure set point is decreased but may not decrease below a low limit "

"open, the supply air temperature is reset to a lower value and the static"
" pressure is reset to a higher value. The room temperature set point "
