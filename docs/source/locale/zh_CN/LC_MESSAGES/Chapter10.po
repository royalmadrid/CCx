"Zachry Engineering Center (ZEC) is a 340,000 sq.ft. teaching and research"
" building, located on the Texas A&M University campus. The building has "
"four floors and a heated-only parking garage in the basement. It was "
"constructed in the early 1970s and has heavy concrete floors and "
"insulated exterior walls made of pre-cast concrete and porcelain-plated "
"steel panels. Approximately 12% of the exterior wall area is covered with"
" single-pane, bronze-tinted glazing. The windows are recessed "
"approximately four feet from the exterior walls, providing some shading. "
"Approximately 3,100 sq.ft. of northeast-facing clerestory windows admit "
"daylight into the core of the building."

"An energy audit of the Zachry Engineering Center was conducted in 1986 "
"[TECCP, 1986]. This audit recommended a lighting retrofit to convert the "
"four-lamp fixtures to three-lamp fixtures with reflectors, conversion of "
"the large dual-duct constant air volume (DDCAV) systems to dual-duct "
"variable-air volume (DDVAV) systems, and a connection to the campus "
"energy management and control system (EMCS). The lighting retrofit was "
"projected to save 975,600 kWh/yr of electricity, 2,500 MMBtu/yr of "
"chilled water and increase hot water use by 832 MMBtu/yr with a payback "
"of 4.4 years. The variable air volume (VAV) conversion, with controls "
"improvements, was projected to save 1,952,776 kWh/yr on fan power, 115 "
"MMBtu/yr of hot water and 265 MMBtu/yr of chilled water. The simple "
"payback is 3.3 years. The university chose not to implement the lighting "
"retrofit, but had variable speed drives installed on the twelve large "
"AHUs, replaced the constant volume dual-duct terminal boxes with VAV "
"dual-duct terminal boxes and connected the building to the campus "
"automated control system."

"The audit proposed that the DDCV be converted to DDVAV systems before "
"installing variable speed drives on 24 fans with associated static "
"pressure sensors and controls. The existing constant volume terminal "
"boxes which typically operated at static pressures above 0.5 in. H2O, "
"were to be replaced by DDVAV boxes with independent controls on the hot "
"decks and cold decks to provide constant minimum flow rates of 0.65 "
"cfm/sq.ft. The new boxes and controls were to be tied to the campus EMCS."
" This was intended to permit shutdown of heating and cooling to non-"
"critical areas such as classrooms during unoccupied hours by closing the "
"dampers in the VAV boxes while the fans continued to supply heating and "
"cooling to laboratory areas. The repair and upgrade of the existing EMCS "
"in the building was intended to control time-of-day settings, DDVAV box "

"Problems of this sort had often led to occupant complaints that were "

"Implementing these measures resulted in significant additional savings "
"beyond the original savings from the VAV retrofit and controls upgrade as"
" shown in Figures A-5, A-6 and A-7. Figure A-5 shows the motor control "
"center power consumption as a function of ambient temperature for 1990, "
"1994 and 1997. It is evident that the minimum fan power has been cut in "
"half and there has been some reduction even at summer design conditions. "
"Figure A-7 shows the hot water consumption for 1990, 1994 and 1997, again"
" as a function of daily average temperature. The retrofit reduced the "
"annual hot water (HW) consumption for heating to only 16% of the "
"baseline, so there was little room for further reduction. However, it can"
" be seen that the CCSM measures further reduced HW consumption, "
"particularly at low temperatures. The largest savings from the CCSM "
"measures are seen in the chilled water consumption as shown in Figure "
"A-6. The largest fractional savings occur at low ambient temperatures, "
"but the largest absolute savings occur at the highest ambient "
"temperatures. The annualized consumption values for the baseline, post-"
"retrofit and post-CCSM conditions are shown in Table A-4. The MCC "
"consumption for 1997 was 1,209,918 kWh, 74% of the 1994 consumption and "
"only 41% of the 1990 consumption. On an annual basis, the post-CCSM HW "
"consumption normalized to 1994 weather was 1,940 MMBtu/yr, a reduction to"
" only 10% of baseline consumption and a reduction of 34% from the 1994 "
"consumption. The CCSM measures reduced the post-CCSM chilled water (CHW) "
"consumption to 17,440 MMBtu, a reduction of 17,820 MMBtu/yr which is "
"noticeably larger than the 13,930 MMBtu/yr savings produced by the "
"retrofit. The CHW savings accounted for the largest portion of the CCSM "
"savings in this cooling dominated climate."

"Figure A-10 presents the accumulated energy cost savings. Since the "
"commissioning process extended over a seven-month period, savings were "
"calculated to be approximately $105,000 during the implementation phase. "
"For the 14-month period (May 1999-June 2000) savings were measured to be "
"nearly $410,000, or approximately $30,000/month, based on 1997-1998 "
"energy prices. Total savings from the commissioning process (October 1998"
" to June 2000) were approximately $515,000. The ESL cost to meter, "
"monitor, commission and provide a year’s follow-up services was less than"
" $350,000. This cost does not include time for the facilities operations "
"staff who repaired kinked flex ducts, replaced failed sensors, "
"implemented some of the controls and subroutines, and participated in the"
" CCSM process. More technical information regarding this case study can "
