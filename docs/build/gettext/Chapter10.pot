msgid "Two detailed CCSM projects are presented to demonstrate the process and the energy efficiency and comfort improvements. Although numerous case studies were presented throughout the guidelines, the complete presentations of the case studies provide opportunities for readers to understand and learn the detailed techniques. The first case study is the Zachry Engineering Center (ZEC) located on the Texas A&M University Campus, College Station, Texas. The CCSM was conducted after a successful energy retrofit. The second example is the Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) located in San Antonio, Texas. The CCSM was conducted three years after completion of the building. This is considered as a CCSM project for a new building."

msgid "Zachry Engineering Center (ZEC) is a 340,000 sq.ft. teaching and research building, located on the Texas A&M University campus. The building has four floors and a heated-only parking garage in the basement. It was constructed in the early 1970s and has heavy concrete floors and insulated exterior walls made of pre-cast concrete and porcelain-plated steel panels. Approximately 12% of the exterior wall area is covered with single-pane, bronze-tinted glazing. The windows are recessed approximately four feet from the exterior walls, providing some shading. Approximately 3,100 sq.ft. of northeast-facing clerestory windows admit daylight into the core of the building."

msgid "Approximately 50 channels of hourly data have been collected and recorded each week for the Zachry Engineering Center since May 1989. The sensors are scanned every 4 seconds and the values are integrated to give hourly totals or averages as appropriate. The important channels for savings measurement are those for air handler electricity consumption and whole-building heating and cooling energy use. Air handler electricity consumption is measured at the building’s motor control center (MCC) and represents all of the air-handling units and most of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning-related HVAC pumps in the building. Cooling and heating energy use are determined by a Btu meter which integrates the monitored fluid flow rate and temperature difference across the supply and return lines of the chilled and hot-water supply to the building. Most of the 50 channels of monitored information come from one air handler that is highly instrumented [Katipamula and Claridge 1992a]."

msgid "An energy audit of the Zachry Engineering Center was conducted in 1986 [TECCP, 1986]. This audit recommended a lighting retrofit to convert the four-lamp fixtures to three-lamp fixtures with reflectors, conversion of the large dual-duct constant air volume (DDCAV) systems to dual-duct variable-air volume (DDVAV) systems, and a connection to the campus energy management and control system (EMCS). The lighting retrofit was projected to save 975,600 kWh/yr of electricity, 2,500 MMBtu/yr of chilled water and increase hot water use by 832 MMBtu/yr with a payback of 4.4 years. The variable air volume (VAV) conversion, with controls improvements, was projected to save 1,952,776 kWh/yr on fan power, 115 MMBtu/yr of hot water and 265 MMBtu/yr of chilled water. The simple payback is 3.3 years. The university chose not to implement the lighting retrofit, but had variable speed drives installed on the twelve large AHUs, replaced the constant volume dual-duct terminal boxes with VAV dual-duct terminal boxes and connected the building to the campus automated control system."

msgid "The audit proposed that the DDCV be converted to DDVAV systems before installing variable speed drives on 24 fans with associated static pressure sensors and controls. The existing constant volume terminal boxes which typically operated at static pressures above 0.5 in. H2O, were to be replaced by DDVAV boxes with independent controls on the hot decks and cold decks to provide constant minimum flow rates of 0.65 cfm/sq.ft. The new boxes and controls were to be tied to the campus EMCS. This was intended to permit shutdown of heating and cooling to non-critical areas such as classrooms during unoccupied hours by closing the dampers in the VAV boxes while the fans continued to supply heating and cooling to laboratory areas. The repair and upgrade of the existing EMCS in the building was intended to control time-of-day settings, DDVAV box load group override, hot and cold deck reset, optimal start-stop of a load group DDVAV box to ensure space comfort, and space temperature reset."

msgid "Chilled water use dropped substantially as well. Figure A-3 shows the daily chilled water consumption (MMBtu/day) in 1990 and 1994 as a function of daily average ambient temperature. Before the retrofit, the consumption depended almost linearly on the ambient temperature, increasing from approximately 95 MMBtu/day at 40°F to approximately 160 MMBtu/day at 86°F. The consumption following the retrofit was approximately the same at high temperatures, but dropped quite rapidly to about 85 MMBtu/day at 70°F and then dropped more slowly to about 43 MMBtu/day at 31°F. There is, of course, considerable scatter due to variation of ambient humidity conditions and certain operating practices. The general linear and piece-wise linear behavior of the chilled water consumption of the DDCV and DDVAV systems respectively, are consistent with the theoretically expected system behavior [Kissock et al. 1998]."

The “measured” savings correspond to those for 1994, which was chosen as a typical year after the retrofit and before the Continuous CommissioningSM process was applied to the building. The fan power savings were determined by subtracting 1994 hourly consumption values from the average hourly fan power consumption before the retrofit. The fractional reduction in fan consumption is very close to that projected in the audit, but the consumption reduction is substantially smaller than expected since the audit engineers overestimated the original fan power."

msgid "Implementing these measures resulted in significant additional savings beyond the original savings from the VAV retrofit and controls upgrade as shown in Figures A-5, A-6 and A-7. Figure A-5 shows the motor control center power consumption as a function of ambient temperature for 1990, 1994 and 1997. It is evident that the minimum fan power has been cut in half and there has been some reduction even at summer design conditions. Figure A-7 shows the hot water consumption for 1990, 1994 and 1997, again as a function of daily average temperature. The retrofit reduced the annual hot water (HW) consumption for heating to only 16% of the baseline, so there was little room for further reduction. However, it can be seen that the CCSM measures further reduced HW consumption, particularly at low temperatures. The largest savings from the CCSM measures are seen in the chilled water consumption as shown in Figure A-6. The largest fractional savings occur at low ambient temperatures, but the largest absolute savings occur at the highest ambient temperatures. The annualized consumption values for the baseline, post-retrofit and post-CCSM conditions are shown in Table A-4. The MCC consumption for 1997 was 1,209,918 kWh, 74% of the 1994 consumption and only 41% of the 1990 consumption. On an annual basis, the post-CCSM HW consumption normalized to 1994 weather was 1,940 MMBtu/yr, a reduction to only 10% of baseline consumption and a reduction of 34% from the 1994 consumption. The CCSM measures reduced the post-CCSM chilled water (CHW) consumption to 17,440 MMBtu, a reduction of 17,820 MMBtu/yr which is noticeably larger than the 13,930 MMBtu/yr savings produced by the retrofit. The CHW savings accounted for the largest portion of the CCSM savings in this cooling dominated climate."

This schedule consumes excess heating and cooling air under normal room load conditions. Also, the heating capacity was limited for some boxes due to the existing box design setting.

The recommendation was made to reduce the boiler pressure to 100 psi, thus reducing losses and gas consumption. The operations staff was not comfortable with 100 psi, but agreed to drop the pressure to 110 psi. The boiler efficiency increased after implementing the new steam pressure set point. Also, the practice at BAMC was to run two boilers year round. As part of commissioning, one boiler was shut down during the summer and swing seasons."

At the same time, the chiller efficiency is also increased."

msgid "Figure A-10 presents the accumulated energy cost savings. Since the commissioning process extended over a seven-month period, savings were calculated to be approximately $105,000 during the implementation phase. For the 14-month period (May 1999-June 2000) savings were measured to be nearly $410,000, or approximately $30,000/month, based on 1997-1998 energy prices. Total savings from the commissioning process (October 1998 to June 2000) were approximately $515,000. The ESL cost to meter, monitor, commission and provide a year’s follow-up services was less than $350,000. This cost does not include time for the facilities operations staff who repaired kinked flex ducts, replaced failed sensors, implemented some of the controls and subroutines, and participated in the CCSM process. More technical information regarding this case study can be found in the references."
