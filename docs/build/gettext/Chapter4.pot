msgid "Air handler systems normally condition and distribute air inside buildings. A typical AHU system consists of a combination of heating and cooling coils, supply and return air fans, filters, humidifiers, dampers, ductwork, terminal boxes and associated safety and control devices, and possibly an economizer. As the building load changes, AHUs change one or more of the following parameters to maintain building comfort: outside air intake, total air flow, static pressure, supply air temperature, and humidity. Both operating schedules and initial system set up, such as total air flow and outside air flow, significantly impact building energy consumption and comfort. This chapter presents 10 major CCSM measures used to optimize AHU operation and control schedules:"

The fan speed control should maintain at least one selected terminal box at the maximum open position [Hartman 1989]. When all terminal boxes are functioning properly, this method uses the least fan power. However, when a terminal box is malfunctioning, this method may not produce the expected savings. For example, malfunctioning flow stations may force dampers to the full open position. The fan will run at full speed to satisfy the requirement of these malfunctioning sensors. Therefore, this control method should be integrated with a static pressure reset schedule [Wei et al. 2000] to minimize the fan energy. The fan speed is modulated to maintain one or more terminal dampers at full open position. If the static pressure is lower than the reset schedule set point, modulate the fan using the damper position. If the damper position signal modulates the static pressure to the reset schedule set point, use the reset schedule to prevent the static pressure from going higher."

msgid "Supply air temperatures, cooling coil discharge air temperature for single duct systems or cold deck and hot deck temperatures for dual duct systems, are the most important operation and control parameters for AHUs. If the cold air supply temperature is too low, the AHU may remove excessive moisture during the summer using mechanical cooling. The terminal boxes must then warm the over-cooled air before sending it to each individual diffuser for a single duct AHU. More hot air is required in dual duct air handlers. The lower air temperature consumes more thermal energy in both systems. If the cold air supply temperature is too high, the building may lose comfort control. The fan must supply more air to the building during the cooling season; therefore fan power will be higher than necessary. The goal of optimal supply air temperature schedules is to minimize combined fan power and thermal energy consumption or cost. Although developing optimal reset schedules requires a comprehensive engineering analysis, improved, near optimal, schedules can be developed based on several simple rules. Guidelines for developing improved supply air temperature reset schedules are provided below for four major types of AHU systems."

msgid "Economizers were set to control mixed air temperature at 55°F for a major university, located in central Pennsylvania, with approximately 20 million square feet of floor area. Observations and field measurement indicated that, on average, none of the zones required the 55°F air supplied by the economizer to handle the internal gains when the outdoor temperatures were below 55°F. Thus, it was suggested that the mixed air temperature set point be increased to 60°F during the fall, winter and spring months, which our testing indicated was the lowest required supply air temperature under those conditions. It was recommended that the cold deck temperature be reset to the mixed air temperature. This change eliminated the need for the zone terminal units to reheat the air from 55°F to 60°F during these months, essentially saving 5°F of reheat for all hours that the system operated during these months. The savings were estimated to be 490,000 MMBtu/yr (20 million ft2×7 month/yr × 30 day/month × 24 hr/day × 0.9 cfm/ft2 × 60 min/hr × 5°F × 0.24 Btu/lbm.°F × 0.075 lbm/ft3).
