msgid "Thermal storage systems are intended to meet part or all of the cooling needs of a building during specified periods of peak demand. It is essential they have sufficient capacity to provide the cooling during these periods. Figure 8-1 presents the schematic diagram of a thermal storage system. During off-peak hours, part of the cooling energy produced by the chillers is used for charging the storage systems that generally store cold water or ice. During peak hours, buildings receive cooling energy from the tank and/or chillers."

msgid "Thermal storage systems save costs by decreasing peak electrical demand during the electric utility’s peak demand window. However, the billed demand may also depend on off-peak demand. Therefore, the cost savings strongly depend on the utility rate structure. For example, if there is a ratchet on the demand, a single system failure during the summer peak can largely eliminate the savings produced by the system for the entire year. Although optimizing thermal storage operation often requires special considerations based on each case, several CCSM measures apply to any type of thermal storage system. This chapter only discusses these measures."

msgid "Low return water temperature is the primary problem with thermal storage systems. A low return water temperature prevents the chiller from operating at full load. Consequently, the chiller may not be able to charge the tank during off-peak hours. A low return water temperature can also significantly reduce the storage capacity of the system. For example, if the building return temperature is 50°F instead of 54°F, the thermal storage capacity will be decreased by 33% if the design temperature difference is 12°F. To increase the return water temperature, the following procedures should be followed:"

msgid "The thermal storage system had problems from the beginning and appeared to have inadequate storage capacity, and/or chiller capacity, to handle the cooling requirements of the hospital during the noon to 8 p.m. peak window. The chiller had to be brought on during some of the hottest days. Figure 8-4 presents the hourly whole building electricity consumption of the hospital plotted from midnight on the left through the 24 hours of one day on the right. The first line visible at the front of the figure is the data for July 31. The second line the data for July 30, etc., with two months of data shown in the figure. The figure shows that on July 31, consumption through the early hours of the morning was somewhat above 200 kW, rising above 250 kW by noon, and dropping to levels near 100 kW until around 8:00 p.m. when it increased to about 200 kW. Hence, the thermal storage system had operated properly and the chiller had not been operated during the peak demand window from noon to 8 p.m. However, many days are visible when the chiller operated during this window. The days when the chiller operated continuously were generally weekend days when there was no penalty for operation during this period. The operators were trying to get the storage fully charged so they would be able to handle the loads during the week. However, several lines are visible where it appears the chiller went off, then came back on in the late afternoon. In these cases the system was not operating as designed."

msgid "These sequences are easy to understand and easy to implement. Figure 8-10 compares the measured facility electrical load profiles before and after implementation of the optimized control sequences. The improved control sequences limited the off-peak demand to 2,000 kW by turning off the 450-ton chiller after 8:00 am. Figure 8-10 also shows that commissioning also decreased the facility electrical load significantly."

Whole campus cooling load is predicted 24 hours ahead of time to determine the cooling tonnage to be charged. Hourly cooling load up to 5 p.m. of the next day is calculated and totaled every hour after 5 p.m. It is then compared with the cooling capacity remaining in the storage tank."

msgid "At 5:00 p.m., the high and low temperature forecasts for the next day are manually entered into the control system. Then the chiller status is determined using the following rule: if the forecast daily cooling is 1,000 ton-hours less than the tank inventory, no chiller will be turned on. Otherwise turn on the chiller and charge the tank until the inventory is 1,500 ton-hours higher than the forecasted cooling load. If the chillers are to be operated, the electrical demand is monitored to make sure that it does not surpass 1,400 kW. If demand drops below 1,000 kW while the 200-ton chiller is in operation and the tank capacity is more than 1,000 ton-hours short, turn on the 425-ton chiller to serve the buildings and charge the tank. If the demand approaches 1,400 kW, turn off the smaller chiller."

msgid "Figure 8-11 compares the demand charges for the base year (1997-1998), after the first phase (1998-1999) and after the second phase (1999-2000). In the base year, the on-peak demand was 1,731 kW and the off-peak demand was 2,736 kW. After the first phase, the on-peak demand was supposed to decrease to 1,400 kW. However, unexpected system failures resulted in an on-peak demand of 1,559 kW. Still, the annual demand charge reduction was 2,215 kW, or 10.0% of the base year demand charge. After the second phase, the on-peak demand was decreased to 1,332 kW. The off-peak demand was controlled between 1,879 kW and 2,207 kW during on-peak months and between 1,318 kW and 1,746 kW during off-peak months. The annual demand charge decreased from 22,158 kW/yr to 18,075 kW/yr for an 18.4% reduction. If the facility were to reduce its contract demand from 2,800 kW to 2,500 kW, it would result in 612 kW of additional demand charge savings. The total potential demand charge savings are 6,910 kW, or 28% of the base year demand charge. More information regarding this case study can be found in “Practical Optimization of Full Thermal Storage Systems Operation” [ Wei et al. 2002]."
