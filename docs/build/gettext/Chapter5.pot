The secondary pumps are used to distribute water to the buildings. The distribution systems can be categorized as source-distributed and distributed systems. The source-distributed system has secondary pumps located only in the central plant. The distributed pumping system has pumps located in the buildings but with no secondary pumps. Most central plants are not pure source-distributed nor pure distributed systems. Most have all three types of pumps: primary, secondary, and building pumps."

Cold complaints were significantly reduced and simultaneous heating and cooling decreased. Figure 5-3 compares the measured hourly cooling energy consumption under both the original and optimal chilled water differential reset schedules. Under the same temperature conditions, the chilled water consumption was approximately 250 kBtu/hr lower under the optimal schedule. This translated into 2,000 MMBtu/yr chilled water energy savings. If the building comfort is maintained at the same level, the same amount of heating energy savings should be obtained. The annual energy cost savings were estimated to be $28,760/yr. This includes $8,760 for pump power, $10,000 for chilled water, and $10,000 for hot water based on energy prices of $0.05/kWh, and $5/MMBtu for hot water and chilled water."

If none of the control valves are at least 85% open, slow down the pump and vice versa. This method requires special attention to all control valves. A single malfunctioning valve may cause the pump to run at full speed. Generally speaking, this method should be integrated with the pressure reset schedule. If the actual differential pressure approaches the set point and one control valve is still fully open, it often indicates a problem associated with the valve or the coil controlled by the valve."

Installing building pumps can decrease total pumping power by as much as 50% when the pumps are controlled and operated properly. The source distributed system will often have water balance problems because it over-pressurizes the control valves of the buildings nearest to the central plant. Due to excessive water flow through these buildings, often the remote buildings do not receive enough water. Alternatively, the distribution pump at the central plant must pump extra water. It is recommended that building pumps be installed for relatively large complexes with several buildings."

msgid "With the original operating scheme, measured pumping power consumption was as shown in the “power consumption” column under “Primary-secondary Pumping” in the table. It shows 65 hp. for each primary pump with smaller amounts for the secondary pumps. After conversion to secondary only pumping, the primary pump consumption was eliminated with secondary pump power shown in the “power consumption” column under secondary-only pumping. We see that pumping savings range from 48 hp. for single chiller operation to 80 hp. for three chiller operation. Removing the primary pumps can save more pump power. However, the flow resistance across the pump is very small when the pump is rotating freely."

The differential pressure reset schedule should consider the impact of the temperature reset schedules. Typically, the temperature reset schedule should limit the chilled water flow below 60%. When the water flow is higher than 60% of the design value, the temperature reset significantly increases the pumping power."
