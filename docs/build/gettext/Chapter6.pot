msgid "The central chiller plant includes chillers, cooling towers, a primary water distribution system and the condenser water distribution system. Although a secondary pumping system may be physically located inside the central plant, commissioning issues dealing with secondary loops are discussed in Chapter 5. The central chiller plant produces chilled water using electricity, steam, hot water or gas. The detailed commissioning measures vary with the type of chiller. This chapter is designed to give the general commissioning measures that apply to a typical central cooling plant that can produce significant energy savings."

msgid "Most central chiller plants have several chillers with different performance factors or efficiencies. The differences in performance may be due to the design, performance degradation, age or operational problems. One chiller may have a higher efficiency at a high load ratio while another may have a higher efficiency at a lower load ratio. Running chillers with the highest performance can result in significant energy savings and will also reduce the number of complaints because you will be providing the greatest output for the least input."

msgid "The chiller performance measurement involves measuring chilled water production and energy input. The chilled water production can be determined from measured chilled water flow and supply, and return water temperatures. Flow measurement is extremely important. Do not assume the flow is the design flow if there is a constant speed pump in the chiller primary loop. This should be measured and can be measured accurately and non-intrusively using an ultrasonic meter. To reduce the measurement error, chilled water supply and return water temperatures should be measured using the same sensor. This is a place where a 1°F error in the temperature difference (typically around 10°F) makes an error of approximately 10% in the cooling output determined for the chiller. When existing meters are used, they should be calibrated before the measurement. The power consumption should be determined from a true power measurement instead of using percent of design current as a surrogate for power measurement. The power factor varies significantly as the chiller load changes. The true power fraction is often significantly smaller than the current fraction under partial load. The true power can be measured using an appropriate power meter. The chiller control panel number may be used if it measures true power."

msgid "If the building bypass cannot be closed, the minimum chiller load ratio should be maintained at 50% or higher. In this case, the primary pump power consumption increases with the number of chillers in operation. Although the compressor power is decreased, the primary pump power increases significantly. The total power consumption is often higher if the chiller load is less than 50%."

msgid "A single loop may be used for some plants. In this case, a control schedule can be developed to share primary pumps under partial load conditions. For example, when the load is less than 50% for two chillers, a single pump can sometimes be used. If two pumps are used, the central plant may use approximately the same amount of energy as one chiller at peak load."

msgid "It is important to follow the operating procedures recommended by the manufacturer. It is important to calibrate the temperature, pressure and current sensors and flow switches periodically. The temperature sensors are especially important for maintaining efficient operation. Control parameters must be set properly, particularly the time delay relay."
