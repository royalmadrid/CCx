The presence of other metering at this site showed that the utility bill was incorrect. Further investigation showed that the utility meter had been changed and was not considered in the bill sent. The consumption included in this bill was greater than if the site had used the peak demand recorded on the utility meter for every hour of the billing period!"

msgid "Savings are determined through simulation of the facility components and/or the whole facility. The most detailed application of this approach calibrates a simulation model to baseline consumption data. For commissioning applications, it is recommended that calibration be to daily or hourly data. This type of calibration may be carried out most rapidly if simulated data are compared to measured data as a function of ambient temperature. Wei et al. [1998] have developed “energy signatures” which greatly aid this process. More information can be found from “Use of Calibrated HVAC Models to Optimize System Operation” [Liu and Claridge 1998]."

It is particularly important that personnel, experienced in the use of the particular simulation tool, conduct the analysis. The simulation analysis must be well documented, with electronic and hard copies of the simulation program input and output archived."

msgid "Efficient building operation begins with a qualified and committed staff. Since the CCSM process generally makes changes in the way a building is operated in order to improve comfort and efficiency, it is essential that the operators be a part of the commissioning team. They must work with the CCSM engineers, propose CCSM measures and implement or help implement them. In addition to actively participating in the CCSM process, formal technical training should be provided to ensure that the operating staff understands the procedures implemented so they can perform trouble-shooting properly."

The same procedures used to establish a pre-CCSM baseline can be used to establish a baseline for post-CCSM performance. This post-CCSM baseline can be used as a standard to which future performance is compared. Consumption that exceeds this baseline for a few days or even a month may not be significant, but if it persists much more than a month, trouble-shooting should be used to discover what led to the increase. If it is the result of a malfunctioning valve, it can be fixed. If it is the result of 100 new computers added to the building, adjust the base line accordingly."

It is essential that the same fundamental approach, used to find and fix problems while the CCSM process is initiated, be used whenever new hot calls or cold calls are received."
